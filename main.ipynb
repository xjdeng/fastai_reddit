      "I've just finished reading Thirteen Days as well as a number of interesting articles that attempt to \"correct the record\" about the Cuban Missile Crisis (including [this one from The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/01/the-real-cuban-missile-crisis/309190/?single_page=true)). Here is where I am confused. In Thirteen Days, RFK makes the case that Kennedy had never really wanted the Jupiter missiles in Turkey, that he had repeatedly asked for them to be removed, and possibly even thought they already had been. Therefore he was frustrated when Khrushchev demanded their removal because it was clear that the US's hardline position re: Cuba was less compelling with their existence. (Ultimately he ended up trading away their removal).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in a lot of contrarian histories I've read blame Kennedy for starting the crisis by placing the missiles there in 1961 (even though plans appear to predate his presidency) and more or less put the responsibility on him for pushing the USSR into a position where they needed a check on the US in Cuba. \n",
      "\n",
      "My question for the historians here is who is correct? It appears the missiles were never particularly effective or advanced in the first place, so why did they go up, why were they left and who does the fault lie with?\n",
